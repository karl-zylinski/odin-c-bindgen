[libusb](https://github.com/libusb/libusb) 

is a library for USB device access from Linux, macOS,
Windows, OpenBSD/NetBSD, Haiku, Solaris userspace, and WebAssembly
via WebUSB.
It is written in C (Haiku backend in C++) and licensed under the GNU
Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or, at your option, any later
version.

libusb is abstracted internally in such a way that it can hopefully
be ported to other operating systems.
