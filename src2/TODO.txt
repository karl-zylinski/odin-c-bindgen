x proc type passthrough
x by-decl-type sorting and spacing
x similar grouping for struct fields (sort by comment_before etc)
x multi name fields (see Matrix in ufbx)
- top and bottom code (head and footer code?) make raylib 1:1 with vendor bindings


-----
old todo:




x proc spacing, comments etc
x enum side comments
x enum spacing alignment

- test macros on other libs

x check declaration -> decl rename status across all files

- calling convention coming from clang always says C, even if I put __stdcall etc

- new examples:
	- jolt + raylib3d

- should Definition be called Definition? It's used for types, but also for literals and overrides.

- add config option for putting all procs at bottom (default is where they are supposed to be in code)

perhaps rename files like so:
translate_collect -> clang_extract (if all clang things are in there)
translate_proces  -> intermediate_process (unsure about this one)

try binding something that needs typedefs between files to work properly... might need one big translation unit for the bindgen config

check old bindgen for c, libc and posix import rules

// A bit of a hack due to aliases being disregarded later. Perhaps we can change that?
