- add macros
	- separate file macros file? collect stage returns the stuff it needs
	- runs between collect and process stage
	- make macros end up at correct position in file (they don't appear in right order in decls array, needs explicit sorting key I think)

- proc spacing, comments etc
- enum side comments
- enum spacing alignment
- can we make the side comment stuff generic somehow? needed for unions too etc


- calling convention coming from clang always says C, even if I put __stdcall etc

- new examples:
	- jolt + raylib3d


perhaps rename files like so:
translate_collect -> clang_extract (if all clang things are in there)
translate_proces  -> intermediate_process (unsure about this one)


check old bindgen for c, libc and posix import rules

add vetting of odin keywords (VET_NAMES in old bindings)
