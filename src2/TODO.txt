- add macros
- proc spacing, comments etc
- enum side comments
- enum spacing alignment
- can we make the side comment stuff generic somehow? needed for unions too etc

- new examples:
	- jolt + raylib3d


perhaps rename files like so:
translate_collect -> clang_extract
translate_proces  -> intermediate_process (unsure about this one)
