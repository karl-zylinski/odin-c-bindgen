- proc spacing, comments etc
- enum side comments
- enum spacing alignment
- can we make the side comment stuff generic somehow? needed for unions too etc
- add macros

- calling convention coming from clang always says C, even if I put __stdcall etc

- new examples:
	- jolt + raylib3d


perhaps rename files like so:
translate_collect -> clang_extract (if all clang things are in there)
translate_proces  -> intermediate_process (unsure about this one)


check old bindgen for c, libc and posix import rules

add vetting of odin keywords (VET_NAMES in old bindings)
