- proc spacing, comments etc
- enum side comments
- enum spacing alignment
- can we make the side comment stuff generic somehow? needed for unions too etc

- add the make_constant bit_set stuff from 1.0

- #by_ptr

- test macros on other libs

- calling convention coming from clang always says C, even if I put __stdcall etc

- new examples:
	- jolt + raylib3d

- should Definition be called Definition? It's used for types, but also for literals and overrides.

- add config option for putting all procs at bottom (default is where they are supposed to be in code)

perhaps rename files like so:
translate_collect -> clang_extract (if all clang things are in there)
translate_proces  -> intermediate_process (unsure about this one)


check old bindgen for c, libc and posix import rules

// A bit of a hack due to aliases being disregarded later. Perhaps we can change that?
